# Historical Perspective 

--

**Otto Loewi** was a German physician and pharmacologist

--

- Showed evidence for chemical neurotransmission in 1921 using frog heart with the vagus nerve attached (in preparation - i.e. still beating)

--

--

- Termed the activating substance in the fluid "Vagustaff" a.k.a. acetylcholine

### The Electro-Chemical Synapse

**Electrical** signals occur within neurons 

--

<center>

<img src="https://www.simplypsychology.org/wp-content/uploads/synapse-1024x387.png">

Within a neuron, electrical signals are summated at the axon hillock, and transmitted down the axon

# Basis of Neuronal Transmission

### The Electro-Chemical Synapse

**Electrical** signals occur within neurons

- **Myelin** increases the speed and retention of electrical signals.

- Bind (and unbind) to post-synaptic receptors ; Get "cleaned up" by transporter molecules ; Sometimes diffuse out of the synapse (e.g. Dopamine)

# Neurotransmitters and Receptors 

--

### Classification of a neurotransmitter

--

1. Synthesized by pre-synaptic neurons

--

2. Stored in synaptic vesicles

--

3. **Action-potential-dependent release** (depolarization, calcium influx)

--

4. Released from axon terminals

--

5. Binds to receptors on the post-synaptic membrane

--

6. Produces a response in the post-synaptic cell


--

---

# Basis of Neuronal Transmission 

--

### Post synaptic receptors

--

1. Ion channels (the *ions carry the charge* in solution)

--

2. Metabotrophic receptors to initiate 2nd messager cascades

---

# Key Neurotransmitter systems

--

### Glutamate

--

- Two key receptor types: AMPA, NMDA

###  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)

# Pharmacological modulation of NT systems

--

### Types of receptor modulation

--

- **Endogenous ligand**: The natural molecule that the body produces to bind to a given receptor. 

--

- **Agonist**: Mimics the action of the endogeneous ligand

--

- **Antagonist**: Blocks the binding site, but doesn't activate it

--

</center>

---

# Pharmacological modulation of NT systems

### Types of receptor modulation

--

- Agonists or antagonists can be **competitive** vs. **non-competitive**

--

Example: Opiate drugs (morphine, heroin etc.) are *agonists* to opioid receptors. 

--

- Naloxone is a *competitive antagonist* to block the effects of opioid overdose.

# Pharmicokinetics

--

**Affinity**: the tendancy for a molecule to bind to its target receptor

--

**Efficacy**: the extent to which the drug is able to produce the endogenous effect at the target receptor. 

--

**Potency**: how much volume of drug is required to reach its maximal effect

--

- The drugs differ in terms of the maximum response they can produce at high concentrations that saturate all available receptor sites.

# Pharmicodynamics

--

#### How the drug moves through the system to reach its target receptors 

--

Example: altering the *pharmicodynamics* of an opioid drug can impact its potency:

Heroin is estimated to be 2x "as strong" as morphine (increased potentcy via altered pharmicodynamics)

- Recovery might require single-housing

# Issues and Limitations with Pharmacology in Neuroscience

### Dirty drugs 

--

- System-specific, off-modality effects

--

- System non-specific (off-target) effects

- genetic manipulations are 'cleaner'
